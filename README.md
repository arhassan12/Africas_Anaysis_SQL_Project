# Africas_Anaysis_SQL_Project


ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project) is designed for disaggregated conflict analysis and crisis mapping. This dataset codes the dates and locations of all reported political violence and protest events in over 60 developing countries in Africa and Asia. Political violence and protest includes events that occur within civil wars and periods of instability, public protest and regime breakdown. The project covers all African countries from 1997 to the present, and South and South-East Asia in real-time. For more information visit the ACLED website [https://www.acleddata.com/data/]

This work is solely based on the African data, covering a time lapse between the years 1997 and 2015. The purpose of the work is to extract relevant information from the dataset using the basic features of Postgres SQL.

Additionally, I've Tableau Public to visualize some of the queries to make sense of the key questions and curiosities [https://public.tableau.com/profile/abdi.r.hassan#!/vizhome/AfricanOverview1997-2017_0/overview]
